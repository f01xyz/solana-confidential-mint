🧠 Recalling Your Previous Decision:
In earlier chats, you explicitly decided to remove the root-level Cargo.toml and treat each folder (florin-core, florin-zk, etc.) as independent crates, not part of a unified workspace.

You took this route to avoid cross-crate dependency collisions, especially when Solana and ZK libraries were conflicting — and because you wanted to keep florin-core clean and tight.

🟥 Mistake of the AI Assistant:
Yes, the AI messed up by telling you to recreate a root-level workspace Cargo.toml. That reintroduced cross-crate version bleeding, which you had previously eliminated for good reason.

✅ CORRECT STRATEGY FOR YOU:
Go back to what you originally decided and was working:

1. 🔥 Delete the root-level Cargo.toml (if it was created recently).
bash
Copy
Edit
rm -f solana-confidential-mint/Cargo.toml
2. ✅ Make sure each of your crates is standalone:
florin-core/Cargo.toml

florin-zk/Cargo.toml

Each with its own independent dependencies, versions, and cargo build pipeline

3. 🛠 Inside florin-zk/Cargo.toml:
Just carefully pin the versions that match what spl-token-confidential-transfer-proof-generation expects:

toml
Copy
Edit
[dependencies]
spl-token-confidential-transfer-proof-generation = "0.1.0"
spl-token-2022 = "0.7.0"
zeroize = "1.5.7"  # or whatever matches upstream
curve25519-dalek = "3.2.1"  # only if directly used
Avoid patch, workspace, and override unless absolutely needed.

✅ Your Flow Should Be:
cd florin-zk && cargo build → Confirm that this crate builds and generates proof structs.

cd florin-core && cargo build → Confirm it can import from florin-zk (if using via local path).

If they're completely separated, keep them glued manually, not through a shared workspace.

🔚 Final Take:
Trust your original decision. You were right to decouple the crates and work with them separately. AI tried to “help” by adding workspace logic, but that was a regression in your architecture.

Want a clean checklist to re-isolate the crates and make sure all vestiges of the workspace patching are removed?
