You're recalling it perfectly:

✅ Split Solana Versions — By Design
Crate	Solana Version	Why
florin-core	1.18.x	Matches your on-chain programs, Anchor-compatible, Token-2022 logic
florin-zk	2.2.1 (native)	Required for latest ZK proof generation (spl-token-confidential-transfer-proof-generation)

🧠 Why This Works
Because:

florin-core handles on-chain state, minting, token logic — all needs to stay in Solana 1.18 to remain compatible with deployed validators and Token-2022.

florin-zk never interacts on-chain — it's an offline ZK proof generation tool that outputs TransferWithProofData and WithdrawWithProofData.

This isolation means you:

Avoid dependency hell (e.g., conflicting zeroize and curve25519-dalek)

Can use Solana 2.2.1 in florin-zk where the ZK SDK demands it

Still maintain 1.18.x compatibility in florin-core for everything else

🔐 Confirm Your Setup:
florin-core/Cargo.toml
toml
Copy
Edit
solana-program = "1.18.2"
spl-token-2022 = "0.7.0"
florin-zk/Cargo.toml
toml
Copy
Edit
solana-program = "2.2.1" # or via transitive ZK dependency
spl-token-confidential-transfer-proof-generation = "0.3.0"
You do not need to force Solana version in florin-zk unless manually calling solana_program directly — the ZK libraries pull it in transitively.

☑️ Bottom Line:
✅ Yes: florin-core → Solana 1.18.x

✅ Yes: florin-zk → Solana 2.2.1 (via ZK crate)

❌ Don’t unify them or force version matching

✅ Keep the crates separate just as you already do

You said:
then why u recommedn 1.18 for flroi nzk toml?


ChatGPT said:
You’re right to call that out — that was a contradiction and a mistake on my part.

Let’s clarify and correct:

🚫 Incorrect Earlier Suggestion
I previously said:

“Don’t mix Solana 2.2.1... keep the stack you’ve tested (Solana 1.18.x)”

That would be correct only for florin-core, not florin-zk.

✅ Correct Configuration for Each Crate
🔹 florin-core/Cargo.toml → uses:
toml
Copy
Edit
solana-program = "1.18.2"
spl-token-2022 = "0.7.0"
Why: Needs compatibility with Anchor, Token-2022, current validator network.

🔹 florin-zk/Cargo.toml → uses:
toml
Copy
Edit
spl-token-confidential-transfer-proof-generation = "0.3.0" # pulls solana-zk-sdk
You don’t explicitly need to set solana-program in this crate unless you're calling something from it directly.

If you do need it, match what the ZK proof crate expects, which is usually:

toml
Copy
Edit
solana-program = "2.2.1"
You determined through tests that this setup works, and it's isolated from the Token-2022 stack.
